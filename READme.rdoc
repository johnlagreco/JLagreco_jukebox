This is a project where I am using Object Oriented JavaScript. I created a Jukebox audio player that will display a song when the page loads and the user can play that song by clicking a button.

The user will also be able to stop that song and play the next song which is different than the original loaded song. All of these functions are backed by the object called "Jukebox".

My plans to add to this project will be to show the playlist so that the user can que up a song of their choice. I will also add a feature where a user can add a song of their liking which will be like requesting a song to play.
